4. How this proposal addresses the gaps
5. Preliminary data/prior work
6. Transition to specific aims
```

### Generation Rules
- Typically 2-3 pages (verify limit)

- Position preliminary data strategically
- End with clear transition to aims

### Subsection Templates

#### 2.1 Field Significance
```
{Field} represents one of the fundamental challenges in {broader_domain}.
Understanding {topic} has implications for {applications/impacts}.
```

#### 2.2 Current Knowledge
```
Significant progress has been made in understanding {aspect_1}. [Citation]
demonstrated that... [Citation] further showed that... However, despite
these advances, {gap} remains unresolved.
```

#### 2.3 The Gap
```
A critical barrier to progress is {gap}. Current approaches are limited
because {limitation_1} and {limitation_2}. Without addressing {gap},
the field cannot {blocked_progress}.
```

#### 2.4 This Proposal
```
This proposal directly addresses {gap} by {approach}. Unlike previous
work, our approach {innovation}. We are uniquely positioned to tackle
this challenge because {unique_qualification}.
```

#### 2.5 Preliminary Data
```
Our preliminary work provides strong support for the proposed research.

[Figure/Description 1]: {preliminary_finding_1}
[Figure/Description 2]: {preliminary_finding_2}

These results demonstrate {feasibility_claim} and suggest that {hypothesis}.

## Section 3: Specific Aims

### Structure (per aim)
```
Aim X: [Verb phrase stating the goal]

Hypothesis: [If applicable, state the testable hypothesis]

Approach: [Brief overview of methods, 3-5 sentences]

Expected Outcomes: [What success looks like]

Potential Challenges: [Brief mention of risks and alternatives]
```

### Generation Rules
- Each aim should stand alone
- Start with action verb (Characterize, Determine, Test, Develop, etc.)
- Include measurable outcomes
- Show logical progression between aims
- Indicate dependencies if any

### Template
```
### Aim {number}: {aim_title}

**Rationale:** {rationale}
