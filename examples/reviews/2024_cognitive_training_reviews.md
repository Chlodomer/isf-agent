# Reviewer Feedback - Cognitive Training Proposal

**Proposal:** Effects of Cognitive Training on Executive Function in Older Adults
**PI:** Dr. Sarah Cohen
**Decision:** Not Recommended for Funding

---

## Reviewer 1

### Overall Assessment
This proposal addresses an important topic but suffers from significant methodological weaknesses that undermine confidence in the proposed research.

### Strengths
- The topic of cognitive aging is timely and significant
- The PI has relevant experience in the field
- Multi-method approach including neuroimaging

### Weaknesses

**Major Concerns:**

1. **Sample size and power analysis**: The proposal states only that sample size will be "sufficient to detect effects" without providing any power analysis. What effect size is expected? Based on what prior literature? How many participants per group? This is a critical omission that makes it impossible to evaluate feasibility.

2. **Aim structure**: The aims appear highly interdependent. If the training program developed in Aim 1 is not effective, Aims 2, 3, and 4 all become meaningless. There is no contingency plan for this scenario.

3. **Control condition**: The comparison is to a "no intervention" control group. This design cannot distinguish training-specific effects from placebo/expectancy effects or general cognitive stimulation. An active control condition is essential.

4. **Statistical approach**: The methods section mentions "appropriate statistical methods" without specifying what analyses will be conducted. Mixed models? ANCOVA? What corrections for multiple comparisons?

### Minor Concerns
- The timeline appears compressed for Year 1
- Budget justification lacks specificity

### Recommendation: Major Revision Required

## Reviewer 2

### Overall Assessment
While the research question is relevant, the proposal lacks the methodological rigor and innovation expected for ISF funding.

### Strengths
- Addresses an important societal challenge
- Includes neuroimaging component

### Weaknesses

**Major Concerns:**

1. **Lack of innovation**: Many cognitive training studies have been conducted. What makes this approach different? The proposal does not clearly articulate what new knowledge will be generated beyond what is already known from existing literature.

2. **Preliminary data insufficient**: The PI reports "trends toward improvement" from a pilot study that were "not statistically significant due to small sample size." This is not compelling evidence of feasibility. What were the actual results? What was the sample size?

3. **Vague methodology**: The description of the training program is too vague. What specific tasks? Based on what theoretical model? How does this training relate to real-world outcomes?

4. **fMRI rationale unclear**: Aim 4 appears somewhat disconnected from the behavioral aims. What specific hypotheses about neural mechanisms are being tested? What regions of interest? The neuroimaging component seems added for appeal rather than integrated into a coherent theoretical framework.

### Minor Concerns
- Abstract does not convey the specific contribution
- Some relevant literature missing from background

### Recommendation: Not Recommended

## Reviewer 3

### Overall Assessment
This proposal has potential but requires substantial strengthening before it can be considered competitive.

### Strengths
- Important research area
- PI has established track record

### Weaknesses

**Major Concerns:**

1. **Timeline unrealistic**: Year 1 includes developing the training program, recruiting participants, conducting training, AND beginning fMRI data collection. This is overly ambitious. Program development alone typically takes 6-12 months of iteration and piloting.

2. **Transfer effects**: The proposal does not adequately address the well-documented problem of limited transfer in cognitive training research. Will training on working memory tasks improve real-world functioning? This is not addressed.

3. **Sample heterogeneity**: "Older adults 65+" encompasses a very heterogeneous population. Will you stratify by age group? Cognitive status? Education? The proposal does not address how individual differences will be handled.

4. **Missing power analysis**: I echo my colleagues' concern about the absence of sample size justification. This is a standard requirement for intervention research.

### Minor Concerns
- Budget for fMRI seems underestimated
- No mention of attrition handling

### Recommendation: Major Revision Required

## Summary of Committee Discussion

The committee noted several recurring concerns across reviews:

1. **No power analysis** (all 3 reviewers)
2. **Aim interdependence** (Reviewers 1 and 3)
3. **Insufficient innovation** (Reviewer 2)
4. **Vague methodology** (all 3 reviewers)
5. **Inadequate control condition** (Reviewer 1)
6. **Timeline concerns** (Reviewers 1 and 3)

The committee recommends that a substantially revised proposal could be resubmitted in a future cycle, addressing the methodological concerns raised by reviewers.
